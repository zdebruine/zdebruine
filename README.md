I develop and maintain the Rcpp Machine Learning Library, featuring fast Non-negative Matrix Factorization and clustering algorithms. Please email me if you have questions about how to use NMF in your work or suggestions for improving our tools.

My goal is to further optimize and expand NMF as a method and promote widespread use of NMF in bioinformatics tools and beyond.
