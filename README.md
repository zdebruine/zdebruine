I develop and maintain the Rcpp Machine Learning Library, including fast Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and divisive clustering. Please email me if you have suggestions or questions about how to use NMF in your work.

My goal is to continue developing fast and simple machine learning methods with application to bioinformatics and beyond.
